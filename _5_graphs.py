#G1 + G2 return new graph with union (triples on both)

# G1 += G2 in place union / addition

# G1 - G2 return new graph with difference (triples in G1, not in G2)

# G1 -= G2 in place difference / subtraction

# G1 & G2 intersection (triples in both graphs)

# G1 ^ G2 xor (triples in either G1 or G2, but not in both)
